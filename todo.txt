TO DO:
- Figure out how to draw the circles and grid correctly
    - grids characterized by center point would make sense
    - where should the grid be vs each player's left pieces?
- Figure out if you should do mouse input or just keyboard
    - maybe mouse to click on the grid and keyboard to select type of circle?


- How do I write test cases for the classes? Or test cases in general?
    - When I start testing this, it'll be this large messed up blob with a bunch of moving parts that'll all get fucked up
